# React Native Client Side Prototyping

In order to implement rapid UI prototyping the client side will use the following technologies that represent a departure from the core application.

- Expo: for the ease of pure JS rapid prototyping
- TypeScript: Expo now supports TypeScript out of the box. The core project using straight React Native will use flow. Since Flow is yet to be implemented, this application can serve as precursor to type checking implementation.
- Some packages may be substituted for lack of Expo support.

# Git

- Git Flow
